        <h4>Benefits of higher education</h4><br>

        <p>College is important for many reasons, including increased career stability and satisfaction, and the ability to make an impact on your community. With more and more careers requiring advanced education, a college degree can be critical to your success in today's workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, workers with higher levels of education “typically earn more and have lower rates of unemployment compared with workers who have less education.” Over a lifetime, reports show that college graduates will make 84 percent more than those with a high school diploma.</p><br>

    <h4>First Semester Blues</h4>
            <p>It typically takes a semester or quarter to hit your stride. Looking back on those early days you may very well shake your head and wonder what all the fuss was about. You might even feel a little nostalgic! A few students, however, may feel overwhelmed and homesick for a while. They may miss their parents, friends, even the family dog. They may find that going to college is not quite what they expected.

         If this turns out to be you, take advantage of on-campus counseling services. Virtually all colleges have such services. Your health center staff can help you get started. They are highly experienced at helping students just like you.</p>


    <h4>Managing your time</h4> <br>
            <p>Students report another source of freshman anxiety: the amount of unstructured time. This is one of the major differences between high school and college. In high school, you may have felt that you were constantly scheduled, with very few breaks. In college, your classes may be spaced out during the day, with free time between each class. Or they may be bunched up into a few days, mornings, or afternoons—leaving large periods of "leisure" time.

            Sound good? The challenge is managing your "free" time. There can be many demands on this time: studying, attending clubs, eating, working, and exercising, just to name a few. It is up to you to work it out.
            
            Here's a bit of advice many experienced college students offer: Don't procrastinate. There is nothing worse than approaching the end of a semester and realizing you have an impossible mountain of work to do. By all means, have a good time—but keep in mind why you are in college in the first place.</p><br>

         <h4>Meeting like-minded people</h4><br>
            <p>What do you enjoy experiencing with others? Whether that's rock climbing or the camaraderie of a Greek society, chances are excellent you'll meet people you have much in common with. On the other hand, one of the big benefits of college is meeting new kinds of people, so going outside your comfort zone might surprise you. If you are a gamester whiz, maybe a rock climbing class will open up a whole world for you.

                Even in bigger colleges, you will likely see the same people in your dining hall, dorms, and classes. Hanging out with students you meet in your dorm hallway is an easy way to make friends.
                
                The important thing is to take that first step. Don't hole up in your room. Cut back on solitary amusements, such as computer games. Introduce yourself. Invite new friends out. Even something as simple as wearing a friendly face can get the ball rolling.</p>
